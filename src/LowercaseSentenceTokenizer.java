  /**
   * Tokenizes the text from the given Scanner. The method should 
   * convert the text to lowercase and split it into words and periods.
   * Words are separated by spaces, and periods are treated as separate tokens.
   * 
   * For example:
   * If the input text is: "Hello world. This is an example."
   * The tokenized output should be: ["hello", "world", ".", "this", "is", "an", "example", "."]
   * 
   * Notice that the text is converted to lowercase, and each period is treated as a separate token.
   * 
   * However, a period should only be considered a separate token if it occurs at the end
   * of a word. For example:
   * 
   * If the input text is: "Hello world. This is Dr.Smith's example."
   * The tokenized output should be: ["hello", "world", ".", "this", "is", "dr.smith's", "example", "."]
   * 
   * The internal period in Dr.Smith's is not treated as its own token because it does not occur at the end of the word.
   * 
   * @param scanner the Scanner to read the input text from
   * @return a list of tokens, where each token is a word or a period
